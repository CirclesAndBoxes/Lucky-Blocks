This data pack is completed, but there's still some residue code in it because I want to add on to it in a bit. 

To get a lucky block, run the command
<pre> /function lucky:give/multi_block </pre>
This gets you a lucky block that looks the prettiest and acts the most like an actual block. This is the one that can be activated without any resource packs or anything.

Do not use the command /function lucky:give/block. This command requires resources packs to work that I have not updated yet.

The command /function lucky:give/easy_block is meant to give a lucky block that does not use armor stands. (This is currently in progress) This should be easier for large scale projects. However, it will be broken by flowing water, so be careful!
